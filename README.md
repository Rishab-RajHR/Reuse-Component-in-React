A reusable component is a component designed to be used multiple times across an application

It helps reduce code duplication and improves maintainability

Reusable components accept props to make them flexible and dynamic

Common examples include buttons, cards, modals, input fields, and headers

They follow the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle

Reusable components improve consistency in UI and behavior

They are easier to test and debug since logic is centralized

Styling can be customized using props, CSS classes, or themes

Reusability makes scaling large React applications faster and cleaner
